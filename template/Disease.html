          Just think if you could have a list of descriptive words about eyes to search through. A list that would
          help you find the perfect words to describe your character’s eyes.

          Word crafting is one of the fun parts of creative writing. Picking the right words makes our stories leap
          off our pages and into our reader’s hearts. Creating the best descriptions of your character’s eyes should
          be fun not agonizing. Frankly, it will be more fun with a little help from our lists.

          A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is severely
          reduced or blocked. The blockage is usually due to a buildup of fat,
          cholesterol and other substances in the heart (coronary) arteries. The
          fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits are called plaques. The process
          of plaque buildup is called atherosclerosis. Sometimes, a plaque can
          rupture and form a clot that blocks blood flow. A lack of blood flow
          can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.

          Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how
          your body turns food into energy. Your body breaks down most of the
          food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your
          bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas
          to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar
          into your body’s cells for use as energy.

          Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious illness that mainly affects the lungs.
          The germs that cause tuberculosis are a type of bacteria. Tuberculosis
          can spread when a person with the illness coughs, sneezes or sings.
          This can put tiny droplets with the germs into the air. Another person
          can then breathe in the droplets, and the germs enter the lungs.

          <!-- Tuberculosis spreads easily where people gather in crowds or where people live in crowded conditions. People with HIV/AIDS and other people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk of catching tuberculosis than people with typical immune systems.

Drugs called antibiotics can treat tuberculosis. But some forms of the bacteria no longer respond well to treatments. -->
