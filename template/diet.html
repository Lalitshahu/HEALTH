					<div class="text" style="line-height: 25px; color: black;">Consuming a healthy diet throughout the life-course helps to prevent malnutrition
						in all its forms as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and conditions. 
						<br><br>
						However,
						increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to
						a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free
						sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary
						fibre such as whole grains.

			<h2>Key facts</h2>
		</div>
		<ul style="font-weight: bolder;	list-style-type: disc; line-height: 30px; font-size: 17px;">
			<li>A healthy diet helps to protect against malnutrition in all its forms, as well as noncommunicable
				diseases (NCDs), including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.
			</li>
			<li>Unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are leading global risks to health.
			</li>
			<li>Healthy dietary practices start early in life - breastfeeding fosters healthy growth and improves
				cognitive development, and may have longer term health benefits such as reducing the risk of becoming
				overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life.
			</li>
			<li>Energy intake (calories) should be in balance with energy expenditure. To avoid unhealthy weight gain,
				total fat should not exceed 30% of total energy intake. Intake of saturated fats should be less than 10%
				of total energy intake, and intake of trans-fats less than 1% of total energy intake, with a shift in
				fat consumption away from saturated fats and trans-fats to unsaturated fats, and towards the goal of
				eliminating industrially-produced trans-fats.
			</li>
			<li>Limiting intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake is part of a healthy diet. A
				further reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake is suggested for additional health benefits.
			</li>
			<li>Keeping salt intake to less than 5 g per day (equivalent to sodium intake of less than 2 g per day)
				helps to prevent hypertension, and reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke in the adult population.
			</li>
		</ul>

			<h2 style="margin-top: 25px; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large; text-decoration: underline;">For Adults
			</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: larger;">
				A healthy diet includes :
			</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-top: 20px; line-height: 30px; font-size: 17px;">
				<li>
					Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize,
					millet, oats, wheat and brown rice).
				</li>
				<li>
					At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day, excluding potatoes, sweet
					potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots.
				</li>
				<li>
					Less than 10% of total energy intake from free sugars, which is equivalent to 50 g (or about
					12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body weight consuming about 2000 calories per day, but
					ideally is less than 5% of total energy intake for additional health benefits. Free sugars are
					all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as sugars
					naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.
				</li>
				<li>
					Less than 30% of total energy intake from fats. Unsaturated fats (found in fish, avocado
					and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (found
					in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard) and trans-fats of all
					kinds, including both industrially-produced trans-fats (found in baked and fried foods, and
					pre-packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, pies, cookies, biscuits, wafers, and cooking
					oils and spreads) and ruminant trans-fats (found in meat and dairy foods from ruminant animals, such
					as cows, sheep, goats and camels). It is suggested that the intake of saturated fats be reduced to
					less than 10% of total energy intake and trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake. In
					particular, industrially-produced trans-fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided.
				</li>
				<li>
					Less than 5 g of salt (equivalent to about one teaspoon) per day. Salt should be iodized.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large; text-decoration: underline;">For infants
				and young children</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 17px;">In the first 2 years of a child's life, optimal nutrition fosters healthy
				growth and improves cognitive development. It also reduces the risk of becoming overweight or obese and
				developing NCDs later in life.</p>
			<p>Advice on a healthy diet for infants and children is similar to that for adults, but the following
				elements are also important :</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: disc; line-height: 30px; font-size: 17px;">
				<li>Infants should be breastfed exclusively during the first 6 months of life.</li>
				<li>From 6 months of age, breast milk should be complemented with a variety of adequate, safe and
					nutrient-dense foods. Salt and sugars should not be added to complementary foods.</li>
				<li>Infants should be breastfed continuously until 2 years of age and beyond.</li>
			</ul>
