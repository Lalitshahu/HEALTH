					<div class="text">Human skin, in human anatomy, the covering, or integument, of the body’s surface
						that both provides protection and receives sensory stimuli from the external environment. The
						skin consists of three layers of tissue: the epidermis, an outermost layer that contains the
						primary protective structure, the stratum corneum; the dermis, a fibrous layer that supports and
						strengthens the epidermis; and the subcutis, a subcutaneous layer of fat beneath the dermis that
						supplies nutrients to the other two layers and that cushions and insulates the body. </div>
					<div class="text">
						The apparent lack of body hair immediately distinguishes human beings from all other large land
						mammals. Regardless of individual or racial differences, the human body seems to be more or less
						hairless, in the sense that the hair is so vestigial as to seem absent; yet in certain areas
						hair grows profusely. These relatively hairy places may be referred to as epigamic areas, and
						they are concerned with social and sexual communication, either visually or by scent from glands
						associated with the hair follicles.
						The skin achieves strength and pliability by being composed of numbers of layers oriented so
						that each complements the others structurally and functionally. To allow communication with the
						environment, countless nerves—some modified as specialized receptor end organs and others more
						or less structureless—come as close as possible to the surface layer, and nearly every skin
						organ is enwrapped by skeins of fine sensory nerves.

			<h2>Blood and lymph vessels</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			Human skin is enormously well supplied with blood vessels; it is pervaded with a tangled, though apparently
			orderly, mass of arteries, veins, and capillaries. Such a supply of blood, far in excess of the maximum
			biologic needs of the skin itself, is evidence that the skin is at the service of the blood vascular system,
			functioning as a cooling device. To aid in this function, sweat glands pour water upon its surface, the
			evaporation of which absorbs heat from the skin. If the environment is cold and body heat must be conserved,
			cutaneous blood vessels contract in quick, successive rhythms, allowing only a small amount of blood to flow
			through them. When the environment is warm, they contract at long intervals, providing a free flow of blood.
			During muscular exertion, when great quantities of generated heat must be dissipated, blood flow through the
			skin is maximal.

		<div class="text">
			<h2>The skin surface</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			The intact surface of the skin is pitted by the orifices of sweat glands and hair follicles—the so-called
			pores—and is furrowed by intersecting lines that delineate characteristic patterns. All individuals have
			roughly similar markings on any one part of the body, but the details are unique. The lines are oriented in
			the general direction of elastic tension. Countless numbers of them, deep and shallow, together with the
			pores, give every region of the body a characteristic topography. Like the deeper furrows and ridges on the
			palms and soles, the skin lines are mostly established before birth. The fine details of each area of body
			surface are peculiar to each individual. Fingerprints are used as a means of personal identification because
			they have a high relief, more evident patternings, and can be easily obtained.
